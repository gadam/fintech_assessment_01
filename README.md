# Cloudvirga case study

## Overview and Origin

Cloudvirga was founded in 2015 by Bill Dallas and Kyle Kamrooz and are based in Irvine California. 

Kyle came up with the idea for the company after experiencing first-hand the hurdles associated with the homelending process.  The process, despite the technologies available at the time, remained mainly manual and costly. So Kyle and his cofounder created a mortgage platform that:
>"leverages data and an intelligent workflow to drastically cut the time and costs associated with closing a loan. The proven system, which has already processed more than $3 billion in loans, is successfully transforming home lending by digitizing, automating and simplifying the process for consumers, lenders, and realtors." (Schulzke, 2016)

According to Tracxn (2022), CloudVirga has gone through three rounds of funding followed by an acquisition raising a total of $101M.  The company benefited from series A round in 2016 through to series C round in 2018 finally being acquired by Stewart in May 2021 for an undisclosed amount. 

CLoudVirga's investors include Upfront Ventures, Riverwood Capital, Dallas Capital, Tribeca ESP and two others (Tracxn, 2022).

The company operates mainly in the US market within the e-mortgage space.


## Business Activities:

CloudVirga offers a Software as a Service (SaaS) product that provides a digital mortgate platform to the home lending and financing industry.  The platform faciliates an efficient homeloan application process through an automated workflow and smart use of data.  It simplifies and automates the process from initial application through to approval (Crunchbase, n.d).

Its customers are mainly homeloan lenders and mortgage originators. Amongst its customer-base, CloudVirga counts Supreme Lending, Finance of America , Fairway, SunWest, Envoy Mortgage, JMAC Lending, Citizens Bank, Summit Funding, TruHome SOlutions, Platinum Home Mortgage, Preferred Rate, and Mortgage Boutique. Bhattacharya et al (2021) report that the US mortgage industry is expected to originate over 2.5T USD for each of the next 3 years. Despite the projected size, the segment is concentrated with tier-1 players accounting for around one-third market share as at the end of 2021 leaving space for tier-2 players to compete on price and tailored offerrings (Fact.MR., 2022).

In the US, loan origination is a lengthy process overseen by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for compliance with a number of handoffs to various participants along the way (Kopp, 2022).  CloudVirga's main competitive advantage appears to be the level of automation that it has incorporated into the platform significantly reducing the time taken end-to-end.  A key outcome for CloudVirga's clients include:
>"...create underwirter-ready loan files in 10 minutes and reducing touch time between loan officer and consumer by 70%" (cloudvirga, n.d.)

>"The platform has an extensive list of companies that have been integrated within the SaaS platform depending on their role in the mortgage value chain (cloudvirga, n.d.)"

The technologies used by CloudVirga include (slintel, 2022):
|Category|Technology stack|
|--------|----------------|
|Marketing|Agile CRM, Yoast Plugins, HubSpot Marketing, Twitter, Google Ads|
|Programming languages and frameworks|Microsoft Asure, JavaScript, Microsoft TypeScript, Amazon Relational Database Service, HTML, Angular|
|IT Management|Datadog, JIRA Software, Microsoft Transact-SQL, Azure SQL, AppDynamics, Microsoft SQL Server|
|Business intelligence and analytics|Tableau Software, Tableau Server, Google Analytics|
|Devops and development|Amazon EC2, Atlassian Bitbucket, Amazon ClondFront|
|Communications|Zoom, Microsoft Outlook, Zendesk, Slack, Mimecast Mailbox Continuity|
|Platform and storage|Nginx, Linux, AWS, Oracle Linux|

|e-Commerce|Pimcore, WooCommerce|
|Networks|AWS Route53, IBM Mainframe|
|Product design|Harvest|
|Testing and QA|Selenium|
|Operations software|Oracle Project Manager|


Although information on how CloudVirga is implementing the above technologies is not publicly available, I would expect that its competitive advantage would come from its ability to integrate across the entire origination value chain.  The opportunies would include: 
* Electronically collect the data and information required to pre-qualify borrowers, retrieve and validate information relating to income, the property and the loan purpose
* Determine the type of loan that the borrower could qualify for
* Collect the information required to formalise the application at point-of-sale, including purchase and sales contracts, W-2 forms, profit and loss statements and mortgage statements
* Automatically perform the underwriting electronically leading to a decisionin a minimum amount of time
* Leverage cloud technologies to scale up as and when required



## Landscape:


The home lending and mortgage segment of the industry (in the US) is currently undergoing a makeover particularly relevant to tier-2 players (Bhattacharya et al., 2021):
  1. Third-party technology and data providers are playing a greater role in streamlining more parts of the process
  2. Non-bank lenders are growing market share
  3. More efficient digital platforms continue to be introduced
  4. Innovative bundling of home-buying services, including mortgages are enabled 
  5. There are increasing signs that nonqualified mortgage lenders are re-entering the market

CloudVirga's competitors include Gladly, ErisX and Recurly (Crunchbase, n.d.) and SimpleNexus LLC, Revel Systems Inc, Roostify Inc, Promontory MortgagePath LLC, OpenClose Inc and Mortgage Cadence LLC (Zoominfo, n.d.).

Research by Investopedia (Tretina & Flores, 2022) suggest that of the 45 lenders that they investigated, an online service was a key feature of the product offerings confirming that most players are converging towards a digital strategy.  However, as outlined in an interview by Digital Mortgage with Dan Sogorka and Tim Von Kaenal from CloudVirga (Smith, 2019), the end to end process is still fragmented and the fintech entrepreneurs are implementing point solutions at different parts of the value chain.  A unified end to end solution is not yet available in the market.


## Results


The three rounds of stage funding followed by an acquisition by Stewart in the seven years since the company's inception point to a successful vision and value proposition by its founders. The company claims to have processed $100B USD in loans for 10 of the top 40 lenders in the country (CloudVIrga, n.d.)


According to Zoominfo, CloudVirga nearest competitor in terms of revenue and employee headcount is Mortgage Cadence however no information could be found regarding where it ranked amongst all the players in that segment.


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
