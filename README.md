## Overview and Origin

Cloudvirga is an e-mortgage Software as a Service (SaaS) provider based in the United States (US).  It was founded in 2015 by Bill Dallas and Kyle Kamrooz and are located in Irvine, California. The company operates mainly in the US market within the e-mortgage space by providing a point of sale platform to lenders and orginators, allowing them to significantly reduce the time taken by the loan origination process (Schulzke, 2016).  It measures its success mainly in the value of loans processed for its customers; the time saved in the origination process and the "reduced touch time between loan officer and consumer" (CloudVirga, n.d.)

Kyle came up with the idea for the company after experiencing first-hand the hurdles associated with the homelending process.  The approach, despite the technologies available at the time, remained costly and largely manual with numerous hand-offs along the value chain. So Kyle and his cofounder created a mortgage platform that:
>"leverages data and an intelligent workflow to drastically cut the time and costs associated with closing a loan. The proven system, which has already processed more than $3 billion in loans, is successfully transforming home lending by digitizing, automating and simplifying the process for consumers, lenders, and realtors." (Schulzke, 2016)

According to Tracxn (2022), the company's investors include Upfront Ventures, Riverwood Capital, Dallas Capital, Tribeca ESP and two others (Tracxn, 2022).  CloudVirga has successfully navigated  three rounds of funding from a "series A" round in 2016 through to a "series C" round in 2018, before finally being acquired by Stewart, a global real estate services company, in May 2021 for an undisclosed amount.  Tracxn (2022) also noted that CloudVirga may have raised a total of $101M.


## Business Activities:

CloudVirga offers a Software as a Service (SaaS) product that provides a digital mortgage platform to the home lending and financing industry.  The platform faciliates an efficient homeloan application process through an automated workflow and smart use of data.  This in turn simplifies and automates the process from initial application through to approval (Crunchbase, n.d).

The company's customers are mainly homeloan lenders and mortgage originators. Amongst its customer-base, CloudVirga counts Supreme Lending, Finance of America , Fairway, SunWest, Envoy Mortgage, JMAC Lending, Citizens Bank, Summit Funding, TruHome Solutions, Platinum Home Mortgage, Preferred Rate, and Mortgage Boutique (CloudCirga, n.d.). 

Bhattacharya _et al._ (2021) report that the US mortgage industry is expected to originate over 2.5T USD for each of the 3 years since its report was published. Within this market, the e-Mortgage segment is estimated at 8.7B USD in 2022 and predicted to surpass 46.2B USD by the end of 2032 (Fact.MR, 2022).  Despite the projected size, the segment is concentrated with tier-1 players accounting for around one-third market share as at the end of 2021 leaving space for tier-2 players to compete on price and tailored offerrings (Fact.MR., 2022). This is where I expect CloudVirga is operating. 

Loan origination is a lengthy process in the US, overseen by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for compliance. The end-to-end transaction includes a number of handoffs to various participants along the way (Kopp, 2022).  CloudVirga's main competitive advantage is the level of automation that it has incorporated into the platform significantly reducing the time taken for the process.  A key outcome for CloudVirga's clients include:
>"...create underwriter-ready loan files in 10 minutes and reducing touch time between loan officer and consumer by 70%" (cloudvirga, n.d.)

>"The platform has an extensive list of companies that have been integrated within the SaaS platform depending on their role in the mortgage value chain (cloudvirga, n.d.)"

The technologies used by CloudVirga include (slintel, 2022):
|Category|Technology stack|
|--------|----------------|
|Marketing|Agile CRM, Yoast Plugins, HubSpot Marketing, Twitter, Google Ads|
|Programming languages and frameworks|Microsoft Asure, JavaScript, Microsoft TypeScript, Amazon Relational Database Service, HTML, Angular|
|IT Management|Datadog, JIRA Software, Microsoft Transact-SQL, Azure SQL, AppDynamics, Microsoft SQL Server|
|Business intelligence and analytics|Tableau Software, Tableau Server, Google Analytics|
|Devops and development|Amazon EC2, Atlassian Bitbucket, Amazon ClondFront|
|Communications|Zoom, Microsoft Outlook, Zendesk, Slack, Mimecast Mailbox Continuity|
|Platform and storage|Nginx, Linux, AWS, Oracle Linux|
|Collaboration|Slack, Adobe DX, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft Project|
|e-Commerce|Pimcore, WooCommerce|
|Networks|AWS Route53, IBM Mainframe|
|Product design|Harvest|
|Testing and QA|Selenium|
|Operations software|Oracle Project Manager|


Although information on how CloudVirga is implementing the above technologies is not publicly available, I would expect that its competitive advantage would come from its ability to integrate across the entire origination value chain.  The opportunies would include: 
* Electronically collecting the data and information required to pre-qualify borrowers, retrieving and validating information relating to income, the property and the loan purpose
* Determining the type of loan that the borrower could qualify for
* Collecting the information required to formalise the application at point-of-sale, including purchase and sales contracts, W-2 forms, profit and loss statements and mortgage statements
* Electronically preparing the material necessary for underwriting
* Leveraging cloud technologies to scale up as and when required



## Landscape:


The home lending and mortgage segment of the industry in the US is currently undergoing a makeover. Bhattacharya _et al._ (2021) found 5 trends that are particularly relevant to tier-2 players:
  1. Third-party technology and data providers are playing a greater role in streamlining more parts of the process
  2. Non-bank lenders are growing market-share
  3. More efficient digital platforms continue to be introduced
  4. Innovative bundling of home-buying services, including mortgages are enabled 
  5.  Increasing signs that nonqualified mortgage lenders are re-entering the market

Bhattacharya _et al._ (2021) further reports that customer expectations for digital engagement have increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Satisfaction drops by about 15 percent if a loan decision takes more than 10 days.  They also found that despite major bank and non-bank lenders investing in uplifting their systems and integrating third-party technologies across various parts of the value chain, many mortgage originators are still using labour-intensive fulfillment and servicing or have not updated legacy processes leading to higher origination costs.

Tier 2 players like CloudVirga and its competitors, including Gladly, ErisX and Recurly (Crunchbase, n.d.) and SimpleNexus LLC, Revel Systems Inc, Roostify Inc, Promontory MortgagePath LLC, OpenClose Inc and Mortgage Cadence LLC (Zoominfo, n.d.) are well placed to respond to the emerging digital consumer expectations with their e-Mortgage platforms, provided they are attuned to the shortcomings of the legacy process and are able to resolve and eliminate the bottlenecks.

Research by Investopedia (Tretina & Flores, 2022) suggests that of the 45 lenders that they investigated, an online service was a key feature of the product offerings, confirming that most players are converging towards a digital strategy.  However, as outlined in an interview by Digital Mortgage with Dan Sogorka and Tim Von Kaenal from CloudVirga (Smith, 2019), the end-to-end process is still fragmented and the fintech entrepreneurs are implementing point solutions at different parts of the value chain.  A unified end-to-end solution is not yet available in the market.


## Results


The three rounds of stage-funding followed by the acquisition of the company by Stewart in the seven years since the start-up's inception point to a successful vision and value proposition by its founders. The company claims to have processed 100B USD in loans for 10 of the top 40 lenders in the country (CloudVirga, n.d.). Given that it was only writing 3B USD in 2016 (Schulzke, 2016) its current level of loans processed represent a 79% compound annual growth rate indicating that its market share is growing and therefore has created, and continues to create, value for both its investors and shareholders.

According to Zoominfo (n.d.), CloudVirga's nearest competitor in terms of revenue and employee headcount is Mortgage Cadence, however no information could be found regarding where it ranked amongst all the players in that segment.


## Recommendations

CloudVirga may well consider uplifting its platform with automated underwriting, thus reserving the step that produces underwriter-ready files only for exceptions.  Removing any manual underwriting step still included in the process would further compress the turnaround time for a loan application and in doing so, better meet the rising expectations of today's digital-centric consumer.  To make the automated underwriting capability even more valuable, CloudVirga could explore the option of incorporating machine learning capability paired with one, or more, appropriate learning algorithms and data sets to increase the accuracy of underwriting decisions and decrease process cycle times (Insider Intelligence, 2022).

A further gain in the automation journey would be to add natual-language-processing (NLP) capability within the application and underwriting sub-processes (Balasubramanian, _et al._ 2021).  NLP would add the ability to more accurately identify potentially problematic applications requiring manual intervention, and allow the remaining applications to be processed automatically. Its originator and undewriter customers would be freed up to be more productive and focus on adding value in the more complex areas of underwriting.  This would be further enhanced with NLP deployed to interrogate the underwriting email inboxes where much of the underwriter's time is spent managing unstructured information sent by intermediaries, third-parties and customers (Insurance Times, 2021)

Given the fragmentation that still exists in the end-to-end mortgage origination process, CloudVirga may also consider diversifying from its home-lending segment and adapting its platform to service the microlending market.  Demand for microloans has increased in the US, particularly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic (Brock, 2022).  The underwriting requirements of microlending are unlikely to be as onerous as those for mortgages and would be relatively simpler for CloudVirga to automate and perhaps even more easily incorporate NLP if it hasn't already.  Furthermore, the microfinancing segment is relatively new with fewer legacy constraints. This means CloudVirga would be well placed to implement a seamless end-to-end process, potentially granting the company the ability to influence the segment's technological evolution along the way.

Yee (2022) reported that Grameen America, a subsidiary of Grameen Bank in Bangladesh - the bank which started the microfinancing movement, has disbursed more than 2.26B USD in microloans.  Yee also found that although interest rates were higher than traditional loans, repayment rates were also high with 99% of borrowers paying off their loans within 36 weeks.

Diversifying and adapting the platform to support microlending would be a capability that CloudVirga could make available to investors active in that segment. It would also lower the barrier-to-entry for traditional lenders in order for them to also diversify their strategy, thus making CloudVirga a more valuable partner for their future expansion plans.
